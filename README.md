# go-program
## Introduction
The go-program library contains utilities to parse command line arguments.
Compared to the standard `flag` package, go-program uses the same conventions
than most UNIX programs.

## Usage
Refer to the [Go package
documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/galdor/go-program) for
information about the API.

See the [`cmd/examples` directory](cmd/examples) for examples.
